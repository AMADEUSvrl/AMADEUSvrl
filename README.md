## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm AMADEUS <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=AMADEUSvrl&&style=flat-square" align="right" />

My expertise is speculative market risk management. 

I do believe in constant enhancement of my efficiency and performance.

One of the ways I improved my trading skills was by becoming a developer. With coding knowledge, I have been able to automate, collect and analyze data efficiently.

Be it creating TradingView scripts or building Metatrader Experts, my mind is always preoccupied with new ideas about how to implement more creativity and problem-solving skills into my work.

On the whole, I'm a pretty easy-going and laid-back individual who is into learning new things and challenging myself.
